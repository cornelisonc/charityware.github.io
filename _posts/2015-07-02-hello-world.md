#Post, the first

A first post. There's not much more to say than "hello world!" and to briefly explain the purpose of this blog.

We'll be posting lots of (hopefully) helpful thoughts on how we do web engineering at Charityware. We're really into The JavaScript &trade;, so it's likely you'll be hearing lots about that through our posts as well as about other cool technologies.

That's about it for now! We leave you with DiCaprio:
